# Information about why my project was created
This project was created as a learning exercise to enhance my skills in modern web development technologies and practices. Through the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in several key areas:

- **JavaScript**: I deepened my understanding of JavaScript, focusing on ES6+ features and best practices.

- **React.js**: I built the project using React.js, which helped me learn about component-based architecture, state management, and hooks.

- **Redux**: To manage the state of the application more effectively, I implemented Redux, learning about actions, reducers, and the store.

- **Working with HTTP requests**: I learned how to make and handle HTTP requests to fetch and update data from APIs, using libraries like Axios.

- **YouTube APIs**: I integrated YouTube APIs to fetch video data, which gave me hands-on experience with API authentication, data retrieval, and handling API responses.

- **Responsive design**: I applied responsive design principles to ensure that the application works well on various devices and screen sizes, using media queries and flexible layouts.

- **SASS**: I used SASS(Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) to write more maintainable and modular CSS, taking advantage of features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

- **Other technologies and best practices**: Throughout the project, I also learned about version control with Git, project structure, and other modern development tools and practices.

Overall, this project served as a comprehensive learning experience, helping me to build a strong foundation in web development and prepare for more advanced projects in the future.
